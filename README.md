# Catacylsm-Faction
A New Faction for Cataclysm:DDA

    "description": "An autonomous group of individuals who mainly lived outside of society before the Cataclysm. They have no desire to see the world return to what it was.",
    "//" : "The anarchists, radicals and misfits of the Old World. The group live as communally as they can under the addage 'From Each According to His Ability, to Each According to His Needs', rejecting formal hierarchies they are highly critical of the aspiring statesmen in Old Guard and the Free Market types of the Free Merchants, Many would have been critical of contemporary civilisation before the Cataclysm and will likely react violently to anyone trying to form power structures that resemble those of the Old World."
